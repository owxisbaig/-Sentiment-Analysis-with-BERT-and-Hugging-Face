Habit Tracker,"¬ª <b>Organize Your Life!</b>
HabitBull is the most powerful multi-platform companion to keep track of your day to day habits and routines<p></p>
¬ª <b>Fully Customisable</b>
Measure and track anything and everything. Follow your own schedule and track your own goals. Get notified whenever you need to do something important.<p></p>
¬ª <b>Cut Bad Habits From Your Life</b>
Simply start tracking bad habits like nail biting, smoking or drinking too much. Once you see the patterns, it's easier to break them. HabitBull keeps you accountable. Also great for users of NoFap!<p></p>
¬ª <b>Add Some Positive Habits</b>
Want to go for a nice walk every day? Or maybe give 3 hugs every Saturday and Sunday? Join us on this journey!<p></p>
¬ª <b>Who is it for?</b>
Whether you want to read some more, stop smoking, start working out or even just track how many hours you wasted on Facebook, this app lets you do it!<p></p>
¬ª <b>Features</b>
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Track multiple habits, repeated to do's or goals, each in its own calendar
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Streak counter and percentage successful for each habit
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Yes/No or Number goals
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Very flexible goals like: number of times per day/week/month, only on certain days of the week etc. For example: 30 push ups every Mon-Fri, go to the gym 2 times per week, or even every 2 days
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Inspiring quotes per category - including actual quotes from people doing it (meditation, reading, stop drinking alcohol, stop smoking cigarettes, stop procrastination etc)
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Graphs with success percentage / streak, entered values etc
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Powerful reminders - multiple times per day, repeating within a time period, sound and vibrate optional
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Home screen / lock screen widget
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Multi-device syncing
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Cloud backup
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Motivational images
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Export to CSV
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Dark theme
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Google Fit integration<p></p>
¬ª <b>How it works:</b>
1. Set up a habit
2. Tell HabitBull how you went for a day
3. Watch your daily streak increase<p></p>
Habits are no more than routines which you perform subconsciously. To build one - train yourself. To break one, find another one which is similar, yet different and nicer, and repeat it until it sticks.<p></p>
To assist you with this HabitBull lets you set reminders for each habit and displays them on days when you need to be successful. This is especially useful if you have a to do list with repeating tasks or if you want to be reminded to do the same thing every day. It can also be used as a calendar planning tool or checklist, but also as a very effective repeating reminder (e.g. to drink water every 2 hours).<p></p>
HabitBull does feel a little like a game in which you compete with yourself. The task is to get a long streak for the habit you are working on by covering your goals. The longer the better. It takes a couple of months to fully build a new routine, so don't give up - it takes time and if you are consistent it will work; even if it takes a few attempts.<p></p>
There are many things which you may want to improve. HabitBull can be used as a planner in building habits like taking your pills regularly, exercise, or keep to a diet. It can also be used as a helper for people suffering from memory problems. As for your vices, HabitBull can be a useful goal tracking tool, or a smart notebook, to assist you while breaking bad habits like nail-biting, drinking alcohol and even improving your dating skills.
It is entirely up to you, really.

Sectograph. Day & Time planner,"<b>Sectograph</b> is a <i>time planner</i> that visually displays a list of tasks and events for the day in the form of a <i>12-hour pie chart</i> - a watch dial.
The application will help you <u>sharpen your sense of time</u> and <u>allow you to visualize your day</u>.

<b>HOW IT WORKS</b>

In short, it is a projection of your routine and tasks onto the clock face. It visualizes your day for precise timekeeping and offers you peace of mind.
The scheduler works like an analog clock face. It automatically fetches all the events from your Google calendar (or local calendar) and places them on a 12-hour sectored watch face. This technology can be called a ""Calendar clock"".

<b>HOW IT LOOKS</b>

The list of your calendar events is projected in the form of a pie chart in the application and on the home screen widget.
Events are sectors, the beginning and duration of which you can clearly track using special arcs to follow your plan.
A calendar and analog clock combined gives you an amazingly visual representation of your work, allowing you to effectively plan and calculate your day.

<b>WHAT CAN THE APPLICATION BE USED FOR?</b>

‚úî Daily scheduling and visual timing. Track your daily tasks, agendas, appointments, and events in Sectograph, and at any time, find out how much time is left until the end of the current event and the start of the next one. Don't be late.
‚úî Accounting and control of working hours. Keep your phone in the docking station at your workstation and your office day plan is under control.
‚úî Schedule of classes. Keep your phone close at hand and see how much time is left until the end of those tiring lectures ‚Äì and never be late for lab work again.
‚úî Self-organization at home. Your daily routine is now more convenient than ever. Remember to balance work, rest and physical activity, just use the app as an organizer for your home routine.
‚úî Trip timer and flight duration. Do you lose track of time due to endless travel and flights? Visually control your check-in, landing and flight duration. Keep everything under control.
‚úî Follow your meal schedule, medication schedule, exercise therapy, and other important activities. Lead the right lifestyle and be healthy!
‚úî Convenient countdown of any lengthy scheduled events. Don't miss the end of your vacation and know exactly how many days are left until the end of your military service.
‚úî Monitor everyday affairs on the go and in your car. Achieve your goals by keeping the application installed on the device.
‚úî Time management using GTD technology. Is planning your day confusing? With the function of striking out or hiding flagged events, keep your chart as clean as possible. Sectograph will improve your time management.
‚úî My goals. The app can be used to achieve goals from your Google calendar. It will help you with timekeeping, organize your day, and assist you in completing your goals on time.
‚úî Attention-deficit. According to our users, the application is effective for attention-deficit hyperactivity syndrome (ADHD). If you are wasting time and have trouble concentrating on tasks, this app may be useful to you.
‚úî The application will be useful for fans of the ""Chronodex"" concept. You can use the Sectograph as an analog of a paper diary used by this concept.
‚úî Display doings from Microsoft Outlook calendar. (beta)

TimeTune - Schedule Planner,"Doing more things with your time. Increasing your productivity. Improving your daily routine.

This is what you can achieve with TimeTune, your time blocking and schedule planner.

<b>WHAT IS TIMETUNE?</b>

TimeTune is a time blocking and daily planner application. We designed it to help you make better use of your time, increase your productivity and achieve your goals.

Have you ever wondered why some people can get plenty of things done in a single day while your time slips through your fingers?

The answer is that they have a very organized distribution of time. They know time is a precious resource and they have strong time management habits. That‚Äôs what allows them to focus, seize the day and do everything in their agenda.

With TimeTune you can do the same.

<b>HOW DOES IT WORK?</b>

TimeTune uses time blocks to build your schedule. Just add time blocks to your day or use time blocks to build templates that can be reused at any time, like a morning routine, a full day template or a timetable.

The template calendar feature allows you to plan your upcoming schedule, routines, timetables or shift work calendar automatically.

TimeTune will show you automatic statistics that will uncover where the time goes and where you can improve.

Also, you can add custom reminders to your time blocks, so you don‚Äôt forget about your agenda: reminders with custom vibrations, reminders with custom sounds, voice reminders, etc.

With TimeTune you can create a time management system as simple or as complex as you need, including statistics. This time blocking and daily schedule planner will allow you to reach your goals and is the perfect complement to your calendar.

<b>WHY DOES IT WORK?</b>

Time blocking is a scheduling method that divides your day into smaller segments of time for specific tasks. When you add statistics to the formula, you get the perfect system to optimize your productivity and become a master of your time.

Time blocking allows you to focus on the task at hand, avoiding distractions and procrastination. It has been proven to increase focus, motivation and productivity.

As Cal Newport, author of ‚ÄúDeep Work‚Äù and assistant professor of computer science at Georgetown University states:

‚ÄúTime blocking generates a massive amount of productivity. A 40-hour time-blocked work week produces the same amount of output as a 60+ hour work week without structure.‚Äù

It‚Äôs no wonder high achievers like Benjamin Franklin, Elon Musk, Bill Gates and many others embraced this planning method.

Also, for people with ADHD, time blocking might be the best single approach to tackle their tasks and avoid anxiety. If you have ADHD, TimeTune allows you to plan your day, focus on your tasks, improve your daily routine and see where the time went.

<b>WHAT CAN I DO WITH TIMETUNE?</b>

With TimeTune you can:

‚òÖ Increase your focus, motivation and productivity.
‚òÖ Do everything in your agenda and accomplish your goals.
‚òÖ Improve your time management habits.
‚òÖ Schedule your morning routine or daily routine with templates.
‚òÖ Set timetables or student calendars with templates.
‚òÖ Set your shift work calendar with templates.
‚òÖ Use the app as your daily planner, weekly planner or routine planner.
‚òÖ Declutter your calendar by removing routine tasks from it.
‚òÖ Analyze your time with statistics.
‚òÖ Use custom reminders for additional motivation.
‚òÖ Free up time for yourself and your family.
‚òÖ Organize your life and achieve a better work/life balance.
‚òÖ Avoid anxiety and burnout.
‚òÖ Get things done if you have ADHD.

<b>WHO IS IT FOR?</b>

If you would like to do more things with your time and achieve your goals, TimeTune is for you.

Additionally, many users with ADHD tell us that TimeTune helps them a lot with their schedule and they use the app as their ADHD and routine planner. So if you have ADHD, give TimeTune a try and let us know what you think.
