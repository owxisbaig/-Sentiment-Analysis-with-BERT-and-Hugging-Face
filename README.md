I implemented a sentiment analysis model using BERT from Hugging Face to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral. I fine-tuned the pre-trained BERT model on a sentiment-labeled dataset to improve its performance for text classification tasks. I applied techniques like tokenization, embedding, and fine-tuning to optimize the model for sentiment detection, which resulted in improved accuracy and faster inference times. This project allowed me to enhance my expertise in NLP and model deployment using Hugging Face and Python.
